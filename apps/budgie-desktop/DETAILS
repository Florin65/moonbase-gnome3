cat << EOF
Budgie is the flagship desktop of the Solus Operating System, and is part of the
Solus Project. Designed with the modern user in mind, it focuses on simplicity
and elegance. A huge advantage for the Budgie desktop is that it is not a fork
of another project, but rather one written from scratch with integration in mind.
