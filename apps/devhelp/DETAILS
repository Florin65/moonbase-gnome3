Devhelp is a developer tool for browsing and searching
API documentation. It provides an easy way to navigate
through libraries and to search by function, struct, or
macro. The documentation must be installed locally, so
an internet connection is not needed to use Devhelp.
Devhelp works natively with GTK-Doc, so the GTK+ and
GNOME libraries are well supported. But other development
platforms can be supported as well, as long as the API
documentation is available in HTML and a *.devhelp2 index
file is generated
