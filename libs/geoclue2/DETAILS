cat << EOF
Geoclue is a modular geoinformation service built on top of the D-Bus messaging
system. The goal of the Geoclue project is to make creating location-aware
applications as simple as possible. Geoclue is Free Software, licensed under GNU
LGPL. It is developed for Linux, but should be portable to any platform that
uses D-Bus.
