WebP is a new image format that provides lossless and lossy compression for
images on the web. WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to
PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller in size compared to JPEG images at
equivalent SSIM index. WebP supports lossless transparency (also known as
alpha channel) with just  22% additional bytes. Transparency is also supported
with lossy compression and typically provides 3x smaller file sizes compared to
PNG when lossy compression is acceptable for the red/green/blue color channels.
