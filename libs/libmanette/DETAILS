cat << EOF
libmanette offers painless access to game controllers, from any programming
language and with little dependencies.
It supports the de-facto standard gamepad, as defined by the W3C standard
gamepad specification or as implemented by the SDL GameController. Convertion
of raw gamepad events into usable ones is handled transparently using an
embedded library of mappings in the popular SDL mapping string format.
