cat << EOF
ModemManager is a DBus-activated daemon which controls mobile broadband (2G/3G/
4G) devices and connections. Whether built-in devices, USB dongles, bluetooth-
paired telephones, or professional RS232/USB devices with external power
supplies, ModemManager is able to prepare and configure the modems and setup
connections with them.
