+ the GNOME panel is the area on your desktop from which you can run
  applications and applets, and perform other tasks.
+ the libpanel-applet library allows to develop small applications
  which may be embedded in the panel. These are called applets.
  Documentation for the API is available with gtk-doc.
+ the applets supplied here include the Workspace Switcher, the Window
  List, the Window Selector, the Notification Area, the Clock and the
  infamous 'Wanda the Fish'.
